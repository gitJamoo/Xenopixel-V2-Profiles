A smoothswing font, created by Greyscale Fonts
Most recently updated: 5/22/2021

"Decay" is a non-canonical lightsaber font, meant to sound like a 
lightsaber with a sinister twist. The saber has a small, fragile 
Kyber crystal, weak enough that the user can master a connection 
with it and unlock spectacular power with ease. The lightsaber and 
the user work in perfect harmony, even if the user has not yet 
mastered their control of the Force. This power, however, comes at 
a cost: the user must sacrifice some of their own life force to 
power it, since the crystal alone is not enough. The choice to 
donate one's life to achieve power is not one to be taken lightly.

Fun facts:
	- This is a sister font to Deadlink, which has the opposite
	premise. In fact, the preon uses sounds from Deadlink to tie
	them together.
	- I don't have a canonical color for this one. I settled on
	indigo, but I don't know about it. We'll see.
	- This is the second font that I inadvertently named after a 
	Void of Vision song. Which is not a bad thing at all. VoV rules.
