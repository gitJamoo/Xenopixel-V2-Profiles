"Crispity" is a non-canonical lightsaber font, meant to feel like a hacked prototype
of a lightsaber. In my head, someone found (or stole) a broken lightsaber and didn't
know exactly how to fix it, so they made some modifications and hacked together a 
saber that doesn't look or sound quite right, but gets the job done.

Fun facts:
	- This is my first original font!
	- "Crispity" was a placeholder name while I was working on this font. I have been
	using "Crispity" to name my playlists on Spotify since Spotify's existence. I'm on
	"Crispity Seven" right now.
	- The person saying "Crispity" in font.wav is my girlfriend Bethany. :)
	- This font has a sister named Ra. Download her too!
