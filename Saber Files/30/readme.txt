"Engine Grip" is a non-canonical lightsaber font composed of sounds from the game "My Friend
Pedro" and synthetized sounds. It's meant to sound like a lightsaber which has been forged
by available parts and a nearly-unstable crystal, and might even rely partially on mechanical
parts to operate. Despite the rough edges, it won't hesitate to fight just as hard as its
wielder.

Fun facts:
	- This is my first collaborative effort!
	- This font was entirely Will's idea.
	- All of Will's contributions were recordings, and all of my contributions
	were synthesized.
	- This is the only font of mine that uses timed blaster bolts.
